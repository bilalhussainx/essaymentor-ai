## CRITIQUE

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- Score: 4/10
- One-sentence summary of the essay's effectiveness: This essay lacks depth, specificity, and a clear narrative arc, making it an unimpressive submission for top-tier colleges.

## STRENGTHS (with specific examples from the text)
1. **Passion for coding**: The essay starts with a clear statement of enthusiasm for coding, which is a good starting point.
2. **Basic life lesson learned**: The writer mentions learning about perseverance and not giving up on goals, which shows some self-awareness.

## WEAKNESSES (with specific examples from the text)
1. **Lack of specificity**: The essay is extremely vague, with no concrete details or anecdotes to support the claims made.
2. **Overly simplistic language**: Phrases like "hard work and dedication" are overly generic and don't convey any unique insights or perspectives.
3. **No clear narrative arc**: The essay lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end, making it feel more like a list of vague statements than a cohesive narrative.

## SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS
1. Opening: Instead of starting with a simple statement about loving coding, try to craft a more nuanced and specific opening that showcases your unique perspective or experience.
2. Body: Add concrete details and anecdotes that illustrate the value of perseverance in coding (or any other relevant context). This will help make the essay feel more authentic and engaging.
3. Ending: Conclude with a stronger statement that ties back to the main theme, rather than simply reiterating the same points made earlier.
4. Voice/Style: Vary sentence structure and length to create a more dynamic rhythm, and avoid using overly generic language.

## REVISED OPENING PARAGRAPH
Here's an example of how you could revise the opening paragraph:

"I still remember the feeling of frustration I experienced when my first coding project crashed for the umpteenth time. But as I persisted in debugging and rewriting code, something clicked – I realized that perseverance wasn't just about solving a problem, but also about learning from failure and growing as a programmer."

## COLLEGE READINESS
- Would this essay work for: Competitive schools (but not top-tier)
- Best fit for colleges that value: Basic technical skills and some demonstration of persistence, but lack any deeper insights or personal growth.
